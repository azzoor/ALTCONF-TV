Learn how an architecture called VIPER will help you squash view controller bloat, decouple your app and fulfill your desires to align to the Single Responsibility Principal. At Coursera, weâ€™ve been evolving a version of VIPER to ship features with small, contained, testable classes which have distinct responsibilities. Meanwhile weâ€™ve found Swift to be a welcome companion to VIPER, allowing us to further abstract behavior into enumerations, promote immutability and write safer code. What patterns have we developed? Have we found new functional paradigms useful? Find out!\n\n\n\nThis talk was recorded at AltConf 2015. Watch all the videos!",

From Simula, Smalltalk, and Xerox PARC, to NeXTSTEP, OpenStep, and Objective-C 2.0, itâ€™s a narrative rich in anecdotes and achievement. But as we ready our farewells, a twist.

    "description": "The session will consist of stories, both personal and otherwise, of how iOS accessibility has changed the world for countless people. I will transition into examples of how ignoring accessibility on the part of developers has a deleterious effect on those users. Such neglect creates a discriminatory gap between those who can get full use from their devices, and those who can't. Because Apple has already done practically all of the heavy lifting, it is unconscionable to fail blind and partially sighted users in this way. I will follow this with three examples of little known accessibility features that are in iOS that are often neglected or blocked by developers. I will conclude with a call to action for developers that will encourage them to be more inclusive, and increase their revenue streams.\n\n\n\nThis talk was recorded at AltConf 2015.

    "title": "Advanced UITableViews for Fun and Profit",
    "description": "UITableViews are the bread and butter of many iOS developers. Theyâ€™re fast and modular, forming the core experience of many apps. At Yelp, we have more than 75 separate table views, including all of our most important screens. However, as powerful as UITableView can be, itâ€™s not all sunshine and roses. Table views bring in an additional level of complexity, which can quickly get out of hand. Back in 2009, we designed a common architecture for all of our table views to make them easier to use. It was succinct and powerful, aimed at addressing the difficulty of sizing variable-height cells. However, as the team grew from 2 engineers to the 12 we have now, our 6-year old framework started to show its age. It didnâ€™t manage complexity well, and was tricky for new developers to learn. Iâ€™ll be talking about what went wrong with the first architecture, and how we built those lessons into a new system. Our new architecture scales easily, from simple table views with only 1 cell class to complex ones with more than 25 unique cell types. Itâ€™s a much thinner wrapper over stock UITableViews, making it easier to understand for new developers. And it has encouraged modularity, allowing us to easily create complex views without writing new cells. Iâ€™ll also discuss some of the tricks weâ€™ve found along the way, such as using child view controllers inside of cells. Our new framework has worked spectacularly well for us, and has pushed the bounds of what we thought was possible with table views. Iâ€™d love to share what weâ€™ve learned.\n\n\n\nThis talk was recorded at AltConf 2015. Watch all the videos!",

Little did I know that it would soon turn into my profession, literally changing my life in the process. I wouldn't say that the same can happen to everyone, but I've learned a lot on this journey the past few years that should illuminate what it's like to put your career in the hands of open source. That being said, here's my story: I started app development a few years ago, following the 'fake it 'till you make it' principle. I then published three truly terrible 'indie' apps, then talked my way into a job/internship with a tiny startup who had previously contracted out their iOS app. And then, one day, everything changed when I found an amazing open source framework that I began to use in my own apps. After meeting this library's maintainer, they let me start working on this really technical OSS library with nearly no experience with that sort of work. Then, last Spring, I picked up CocoaPods development on a whim when I got bored the first week of the quarter at college. I even got to spend three months working on CocoaPods full-time. I now work for a company whose product is open source. Along the way, I've picked up a real love of discovering the 'perfect' way to build stuff. And I've gotten to work on open source for a living. I've been living out a dream, but I'm sure you can apply some of the lessons I've learned to your own career.\n\n\n\nThis talk was recorded at AltConf 2015. Watch all the videos!",

    "description": "With more competition than ever, it's harder than ever to build a product company that supports itself through App Store sales. It's especially difficult these days to come up with app ideas that have the earning potential needed to sustain a business over the long term. Far too many developers have a great product idea, build it, and then are disappointed when sales don't follow. But a lot of these products fail in the market not because they're bad apps, but because their creators were thinking like programmers, and not like entrepreneurs. In this presentation, we'll explore the typical \"product first\" approach to app development that most developers employ, and why it so often leads to disappointment in the marketplace. Once we understand what doesn't work, we'll turn our attention to a \"market first\" approach that holds much more promise in creating app ideas that result in profit. You'll learn the most important factors in the success of a product (Spoiler alert: Your app's feature list isn't one of them.) and why niches are the name of the game. Along the way, you'll learn a framework for evaluating potential markets, and how to identify product ideas that customers are happy to pay for.\n\n\n\nThis talk was recorded at AltConf 2015.

    "title": "Correct Behavior Through Type Safety",
    "description": "Swift has brought a much stronger type system to Cocoa development, which helps catch more bugs at compile-time, before they ship and affect real users. But itâ€™s not enough to bring Objective-C patterns to Swift, sprinkle in a few types, and call it done. Justin Spahr-Summers, core contributor to Carthage, ReactiveCocoa & Mantle, explains how types can be used to ensure correctness, how to prevent the existence of invalid states, and why unit tests just arenâ€™t enough. Along the way, heâ€™ll dive into some specific approaches to correctness that will take advantage of Swiftâ€™s strong type system.\n\n\nThis talk was recorded at AltConf 2015.

    "description": "In this talk, we'll take a look at examples of products that are designed well, not because of how they look, but how they work. The small decisions made along the way that contribute to success. We'll also talk about avoiding the common pitfalls of design for design's sake. Over-abundant animations, the obsession with \"clean\" interfaces that lack function, making our products so opinionated that only we like themâ€”all the things we designers tend to fawn over that don't matter much to most people. Finally, we'll talk about balancing the need to serve our customers' best interests, vs. our own needs to survive as a company. You can't build products for people, after all, if you go out of business. Successful design solves problems. Well designed products meet needs. Focus your energy there, and you will build something truly great.\n\n\n\nThis talk was recorded at AltConf 2015. Watch all the videos!",

We'll also cover which gestures are the most and least intuitive for small fingers, how the way children hold tablets affects UI, and what content to include for parents (and for legal reasons) and how.

    "description": "The idea of my presentation is to demonstrate a QoS aware information retrieval framework that will complement Apple's ResearchKit. This will aid the medical research community to increase the degree of participation among iPhone user groups and capture more significant and relevant data. (https://developer.apple.com/researchkit/researchkit-technical-overview.pdf). The success of the proposed ResearchKit widely depends on the users' participation and willingness to share large amount of information collected via mobile phone sensors. My proposed research kit helper will provide probabilistic data aggregation and query processing filters to minimise network traffic while still maintaining the quality of survey results. A number of quality adjustable query processing filters will be prebuilt as part of my ResearchKit helper and will be configurable via backend. The core features and strengths of the proposed ResearchKit Helper framework: - It will provide basic data processing filters. Researchers are not interested in bulk data (motion sensor or activity data from phone), rather statistically significant representative data will be produced. - A number of generic probabilistic models will be pre-built (e.g. Merge distributions) - This will enable the research community to engage larger audience. - Degree of participation will be higher as this will minimise the data traffic for research survey - Configurable data processing filters that can be adjusted from a remote backend. - Proposed framework will also facilitate anonymization of data for protecting user's privacy\n\n\n\nThis talk was recorded at AltConf 2015.

Equally, weâ€™ve also often talked about user centric design, and hence keep their goals and expectations in mind, while trying to achieve our business goals. With this talk however Iâ€™d like to take the discussion a bit further from onboarding and hamburger menus, and more towards designing/developing for human experiences. Human experience is, in my opinion, centered around fitting into a userâ€™s daily tasks, moods, and lifestyle, with the goal to enhance them. As is often said nowadays, phones are an extension of our every day lives, and as apps demanding time and attention, we should make sure to do so in the most natural and cohesive ways. This means taking it further than platform affordances. Our apps shouldnâ€™t just fit into the style of the device, and other apps similar, it should fit into a userâ€™s every day life. In order to do so, we need to better understand people, their interactions with mobile, and the extent to which design can affect moods and perception.\n\n\n\nThis talk was recorded at AltConf 2015.

The out-of-the-box tools are still a bit anemic and a lot of testing ends up being confined to unit testing because it's too much of a hassle, or too slow, to test what should be. I'd like to cover some improvements to how BDD can be done, using Cedar as an example, and several custom extensions to Objective-C's runtime (which would function in any testing environment). ('Try that in swift!' could be a subtitle for this talk. . . . ) Specifically, I'll cover how to intercede in the runtime to make time pass without waiting, to intercept & munge network communications (including with NSURLSession, which was more challenging than previous techniques), to collapse animations, and how to otherwise get Apple's systems out of the way to test what you want to. I'll also talk about what to test and what not to test, to dial in the level of coverage desired to fit the situation. The techniques covered include method swizzling and posing, so I selected 'advanced' above. But depending on the audience, I could focus on the more interesting and unusual tools or try to support a mechanism for making BDD testing drive good implementations. I'm pretty flexible. If this is the place to be less than humble, I've got a 5.0 rating on 'ratemyprofessor.com', won Berkeley's teaching award, and in general try to be entertaining.\n\n\n\nThis talk was recorded at AltConf 2015.

Instead this talk goes for a different approach by showing examples of unfunctional, imperative code that people write every day and how we can translate that to a functional declarative style. This talk is not a talk on reactive/functional programming, it will just cover how these styles allow us to write declarative code (note: it would a great talk to have before a talk on ReactiveCocoa or such).\n\n\n\nThis talk was recorded at AltConf 2015.

    "description": "At Facebook, we already created and use a very popular reactive UI library for the web: ReactJS. We have recently decided to use similar functional design techniques to build a reactive UI layer on iOS called **ComponentKit**, which is now open sourced. This talk will focus on the description of the advantages of reactive UI, the structure and concepts behind ComponentKit. Finally, it will touch down on other libraries we built at FB that address problems in the same area, namely react native and Async Display Kit.\n\n\n\nThis talk was recorded at AltConf 2015.

    "description": "New language, new programming paradigms. Since the release of Swift the Cocoa developer community is increasingly experimenting with functional programming. How can we adopt FP principles in real world applications? This talk will discuss how apps can make use of immutable value types to avoid common code smells and bugs. I will also discuss other benefits of a functional approach, such as modularity through function composition. Throughout the talk I will illustrate the architecture of a non-trivial iOS app that relies strongly on immutable value types. The main goal of this talk is to show pragmatic approaches for applying functional programming principles to common problems in Cocoa development.\n\n\n\nThis talk was recorded at AltConf 2015.

    "description": "Social coding has revolutionized how we share code with others. Tools like GitHub, CocoaPods, and Carthage make publishing and consuming code so convenient that our dependencies have become smaller and more numerous. Nowadays, most projects quickly resemble a Jenga tower, with layer upon layer of poorly understood single points of failure. Despite our progress, Justin Searls urges us to pause and reflect on our relationship with open source. Convenience and ego drive most open source adoption, he says, but these shortsighted motivations raise long-term problems we will need to clearly identify if we ever hope to solve them.",

    "description": "A lot of our jobs are about designing 'delightful experiencesâ€, but what makes a user feel delight? As iOS developers we care for nice applications and good user experiences. Equally, weâ€™ve also often talked about user centric design, and hence keep their goals and expectations in mind, while trying to achieve our business goals. With this talk however Iâ€™d like to take the discussion a bit further from onboarding and hamburger menus, and more towards designing/developing for human experiences. Human experience is, in my opinion, centered around fitting into a userâ€™s daily tasks, moods, and lifestyle, with the goal to enhance them. As is often said nowadays, phones are an extension of our every day lives, and as apps demanding time and attention, we should make sure to do so in the most natural and cohesive ways. This means taking it further than platform affordances. Our apps shouldnâ€™t just fit into the style of the device, and other apps similar, it should fit into a userâ€™s every day life. In order to do so, we need to better understand people, their interactions with mobile, and the extent to which design can affect moods and perception.\n\n\n\nThis talk was recorded at AltConf 2015.
